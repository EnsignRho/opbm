* Note:  I developed this project from May 2011 through Nov 2011
*        working for Van Smith at Canalabs as a contractor.  There
*        were some bug fixes made after I was no longer involved
*        with the project, but 99.5% of what you see here is work
*        I created ... my first project of significance in Java,
*        and a tremendous degree of satisfaction to have been able
*        do accomplish all I did.
*
*        :-)
*
*        I am also very thankful for the help given us by the folks
*        at AMD.  They gave us breathing room, yet maintained a
*        guiding hand, offering helpful advice when needed.
*
*        I am also grateful to the Lord for the opportunity to work
*        on this project with Van and Kathy Smith, both of whom are
*        devout Christians. It afforded me the ability to take nearly
*        two months off work and tend to my mother's needs when she
*        was in the final stages of cancer.  She died January 19,
*        2012 (Ellen Lynn Hodgin, 67) and I was able to be with her
*        day-in/day-out from mid-November on through the last weeks
*        of her life.
*
*        I would not trade anything for that precious time together.
*        It was a tremendous blessing given me by the Lord, and to
*        my mother, and I am oh so very thankful for who He is, and
*        what He has done.
*
*        In much love,
*        Rick C. Hodgin
